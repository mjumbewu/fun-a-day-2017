Fun-a-day 2017
==============

I've been meaning to do this [fun-a-day](http://www.artclash.com/) project for
a few years. I originally called it "sim-a-day", but I imagine some of these
won't strictly be simulations. They may be visualizations or some other kind of
digital representation of some real phenomenon.

With luck, I'll see you at [Fun-A-Day Philadelphia](https://www.facebook.com/FunaDay/)!
